/*
 * The GPIOâ€™s shown in the blue box (1, 3, 9, 10) are mostly not used for GPIO purpose on Dev Kit
 * ESP8266 is a System on Chip (SoC) design with components like the processor chip. The processor has around 16 GPIO lines, some of which are used internally to interface with other components of the SoC, like flash memory.
 * Since several lines are used internally within the ESP8266 SoC, we have about 11 GPIO pins remaining for GPIO purposes.
 * Now again 2 pins out of 11 are generally reserved for RX and TX in order to communicate with a host PC through which compiled object code is downloaded.
 * Hence finally, this leaves just 9 general-purpose I/O pins i.e. D0 to D8.
 * As shown in the above figure of NodeMCU Dev Kit. We can see RX, TX, SD2, SD3 pins are not mostly used as GPIOs since they are used for other internal processes. But we can try with SD3 (D12) pin which mostly likes to respond for GPIO/PWM/interrupt like functions.
 * Note that the D0/GPIO16 pin can be only used as GPIO read/write, no special functions are supported on it.
